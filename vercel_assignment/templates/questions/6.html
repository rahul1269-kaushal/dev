    <p> Answer: Hello Customer_Name,

        I completely understand your concerns and the frustration you're experiencing.
        
        Could you please consider sharing access to your repository or making it public? This way, I can clone it and perform a test deployment on my end. From the troubleshooting conducted so far, I haven't identified any specific errors in the build logs that could indicate a platform issue.
        
        If sharing repository access isn't feasible, could you provide details about the exact module where you're encountering the error? I can then try integrating that module into my test application for further investigation.
        
        I'll be eagerly awaiting your response. </p>
    <p> </p>
